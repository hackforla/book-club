## How does this work?

No idea - have any thoughts on that?  Open an Issue to leave a comment, or start up a conversation in the Hack for LA Slack's #book-club channel!

Here's one resource I found:

* Any Book Book Club - https://bookriot.com/2015/03/04/book-book-club/!

> This idea came about as a few of us raved about books we had recently read.  We threw around the idea of having a book club where we all talk about the books we've read recently so we could share knowledge and inspire others to read worthwhile books.
>
> Then a friend saw that I was reading Jane Jacobs and expressed interest in starting a book club on her books!  We decided to commit to meeting in person as an incentive to read and then discuss our thoughts.
